## World Happiness Visualization
###### Exploring the relationship between the __happiness__ (Happiness Score) of countries against their __health__ (Life Expectancy) and __wealth__ (GDP per capita).
------

Using a survey of 158 out of 195 countries in 2015, we focus on whether health and wealth affect the happiness of citizens in a country, and if so, explore the direction and strength of their correlation. We identify trends and outliers without delving into the social/political/economical causes for them.

_Overview:_
1. Scatterplot: 
   - Visualize the relationship between happiness and wealth. 
   - Explore seaborn, matplotlib, plotly.express libraries. 
   - Add dimensions to data using color and size of circle. 
2. GeoSpatial Graphs: 
   - Analyze the geographical relationships using folium choropleth maps
   - Examine map styles: cartodb positron, Stamen Watercolor, Stamen Toner, Stamen Terrain
3. Waffle Charts: 
   - Answer the question "How happy is the world?" using Waffle from pywaffle library
4. Experiments:
   - Investigate different division of data and its corresponding visualization
   - Explore features of the Waffle library, such as icons
